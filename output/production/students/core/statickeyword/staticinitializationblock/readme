Static initialization blocks are great for preparing a class before we use it.


setting up something based on a conditional, as shown below:


a ONE TIME "type initialization" is performed - these execute automatically before the type's first use:

They automatically execute before any of your constructors
 

static double a;
static {
    if (SomeCondition) {
      a = 0;
    } else {
      a = 1;
    }
}
