constructors:

They execute code used during object creation 
to set the initial state of the object.

- have no return type
- every class has at least one constructor if no explicit constructor is provided.

- a class can have multiple constructors - each w/ its own parameter list/signature

- once you write any constructor, you are not responsible for ALL the constructors


Constructor Chaining:

	ex: public Passenger (int freeBags, int checkedBags) {
	    this(freeBags);
	    this.checkedBags = checkedBags;
	    }
	    
	   
The order in which the fields get set are:

	1. field initialization in the initial declaration
	
	2. initialization block { }

	3. In the constructor
	

	
In Java, constructors are NOT inherited!!!
Each class is responsible for defining its own constructors.
However, a derived class must call ONE of the base class constructors.
