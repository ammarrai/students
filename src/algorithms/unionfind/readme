Modeling the Connections:
	Reflexive:  p is connected to p.
	Symmetric: if P is connected to Q, then Q is connected to P.
	Transitive: if P is connected to q AND Q is connected to R ,then P is connected to R.
	
	
Connected Components
	Maximal set of objects that are mutually connected.
	
	
	
Implementing the operations:

Find query: check if two objects are in the same component.

Union command: replace components containing two objects with their union.
