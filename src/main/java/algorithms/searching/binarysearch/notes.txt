In a Binary Search Tree (BST):

the left sub-tree is lesser than the parent.

the right sub-tree is greater than the parent.

     E
   B   M
 A C   L Q


 Another example:

     42
     /
   32
   /
 12

This is valid as all the numbers in the left-subtree(s) are smaller.
Even though there's no right-subtree to this.

How does searching actually work?

Let's say we're trying to find C from the above example.

Is "E == C"? no
E is greater than C. Therefore, we search in the LEFT sub-tree, for values that are smaller than E.
Is "B == C"? no
B is smaller than C. Therefore, we search in the right sub-tree.
Is "C == C" Yes.
