Keep all words in the same list. No need to keep capitalized words, or words ending in periods
in separate lists.

Example:

if "." in word:
    if not next_word[0].isupper():
         # Select a different word

Words with periods after them won't be in the middle of a sentence.
But this is good. It makes it easier to generate more accurate sentences, rather than ending in
the middle of a sentence.

Assuming I give a gigantic sample of text, there will be plenty of words that are like

"This", "this", "this.".

----------------------------

Conversely, use <END> tokens.

Example: "This is going really well <END> This is fun <END>"
