an interface defines a contract - they do not provide any implementation.

classes that implement interfaces indicate that they confirm to a contract.

interfaces don't limit other aspects of a class' implementation.

The java.lang.Comparable interface is used for comparing relative order.
compareTo : receives item to compare to.
Return indicates current instance relative sequence.
Negative value: current instance comes before 
Positive value: current instance comes after
Zero value: equal
