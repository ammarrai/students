most stream operations take a lambda expression.

stream operations are categorized as intermediate or terminal.

terminal operations are either void, or return a type.

intermediate operations return the stream itself.

common used operations include map, filter, and forEach

map and filter are intermediate operations, they allow us to map
one value to another or to filter a result using a predicate.

forEach is a terminal operator.

sorted() and collect() are also two very helpful operations.
    sorted() is an intermediate operation.
