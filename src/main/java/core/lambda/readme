JSR 335 - Lambda Expressions

Often used to replace anonymous inner classes. If you recall, Anonymous inner classes are decalred
by using the Object class. Like so:

new Object() {

    anonymousMethod(){

    }

}


This method is then called like so:

.anonymousMethod()

Two new packages added to Java 8:

What is a functional interface?

An interface that contains at least one abstract method.
represents abstract concepts such as functions, actions, or predicates.

predicates - take one argument, return a boolean.
consumer - accepts a single argument with no return value.
function - accepts one argument and produces a result.
supplier - do not accept arguments, but produces a result of a given type.
unary operator - single argument with a return value.
binary operator - takes two arguments and returns one.
