client : GenerateBill : Uses GetPlanFactory 

factory : GetPlanFactory simply uses the appropriate concrete implementation

concrete_classes : CommercialPlan, etc.; provide methods that compute the bill accordingly

abstract superclass : Plan : declares an abstract getRate method which is defined in the concrete classes



WHEN TO USE:
A class will not know what classes it will be required to create.
n Subclasses may specify what objects should be created.
n Parent classes wish to defer creation to their subclasses.


Many applications have some form of user and group structure
for security. When the application needs to create a user it will
typically delegate the creation of the user to multiple user
implementations. The parent user object will handle most
operations for each user but the subclasses will define the factory
method that handles the distinctions in the creation of each type
of user. A system may have AdminUser and StandardUser objects
each of which extend the User object. The AdminUser object
may perform some extra tasks to ensure access while the
StandardUser may do the same to limit access.
